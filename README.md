# Workshop Portfolio Project with React and CSS

## Overview

Welcome to our Web Development Workshop! This project repository is the starting point for creating your own personal portfolio using React and CSS. Throughout this workshop, you will learn how to structure your web application with React components, style it attractively with CSS, and add interactivity that enhances the user experience. By the end of this session, you will have a live portfolio to showcase your projects, skills, and testimonials.

## Workshop Goals

- Understand the basics of React and JSX.
- Learn to style components with CSS and create responsive layouts.
- Implement React state management and hooks for dynamic content.
- Use React Router for navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
- Develop a personal portfolio project to showcase individual achievements and skills.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub (or Gitlab)
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Getting Started

Before we begin coding, make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workshop-portfolio-project.git
cd workshop-portfolio-project
```

### Install Dependencies

To install the necessary npm packages, run the appropriate command in the root directory of your project.
```bash
npm install
```
### Running the Application

To start the development server and run your application, execute the appropriate npm command.
```bash
npm start
```

## Development Workflow

As you follow along with the workshop, you'll be creating React components that correspond to different sections of your portfolio. For each feature or section, you'll:

1. Create a new component in the `src/components` directory.
2. Style your component with a corresponding CSS file.
3. Import and use your component in the main application file (`App.js`).

Remember to commit your changes frequently and push them to your GitHub repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```
